# Password-Generator
```
AS a developer I want to provide my clients' employees with access to sensitive data
I WANT my clients to be able to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT their employees can create a strong password that provides greater security


## Installation
WHEN the user clicks the button to generate a password
They are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN the user select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
The user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 12 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
The user chooses lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN the user answers each prompt
THEN the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
